# AI Data Analysis Assistant

An AI-driven data analysis assistant that simulates a team of AI personas (Manager, Analyst, Associate) to guide users through a structured data analysis process based on uploaded CSV data.

## Features

- **AI Manager**: Creates structured analysis plans based on your project goals
- **AI Analyst**: Examines data details and executes specific analysis tasks
- **AI Associate**: Provides guidance, hypotheses, and insights for analysis
- **Interactive Reports**: Generate comprehensive HTML reports of your analysis
- **CSV Data Processing**: Upload and analyze your CSV data files
- **Conversation History**: Track interactions with different AI personas

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Gemini API key (free tier)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-data-assistant.git
   cd ai-data-assistant
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Gemini API key:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key.

## Running the Application

Run the Streamlit application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
